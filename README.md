The demonstration videos can be found at the end of the paper: Supplementary Video 1.mp4 and Supplementary Video 2.mp4.

Supplementary Video 1.mp4 shows a comparative real-time object tracking demonstration between GIER-DETR+FIC-ByteTrack (our method) and RT-DETR+ByteTrack.

Supplementary Video 2.mp4 presents a demonstration of the actual site and real-time analysis.
